# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
2020 NC 812/Internet of Things

Driver drowsiness has always been a major cause of road accidents. We have designed a drowsiness detection system that can monitor drivers and prevent potential disasters. We have considered behavioral measures to detect the drowsiness conditions. We have used Computer Vision techniques to create our detection algorithm. EAR (eye aspect ratio), MAR (mouth aspect ratio) and head tilt are the measurements that we chose to detect drowsiness.
